## FAQ

**Do I need expensive 360° cameras to create professional virtual tours?**

Many platforms including TeliportMe and Panoee support smartphone capture, letting you create tours using devices already in your pocket without purchasing specialized cameras. Matterport and Kuula similarly offer smartphone apps capturing 360° content, though image quality improves with dedicated cameras like Ricoh Theta or Insta360. Start with smartphones testing virtual tour effectiveness for your business before investing $300-500 in entry-level 360° cameras. Professional results depend more on proper lighting, composition, and editing than camera equipment alone.

**Can these platforms integrate virtual tours directly into real estate listing websites?**

CloudPano, Kuula, and TeliportMe provide direct integration with major real estate platforms including Zillow, Realtor.com, Compass, and MLS systems through automated export and embed features. Most platforms generate iframe embed codes or direct URLs that insert into listing platform virtual tour fields. Matterport tours integrate seamlessly with high-end real estate platforms popular for luxury properties. Verify specific listing platform compatibility before committing to virtual tour software, as integration methods vary by platform and region.

**How long does it take to create a complete virtual tour for a property?**

Capturing 360° images for average residential properties takes 30-60 minutes depending on size and complexity. Uploading, stitching, and editing tours through user-friendly platforms like Panoee or Kuula requires an additional 15-30 minutes. Total time from shoot to published tour averages 1-2 hours for experienced users, with beginners potentially requiring 3-4 hours learning software interfaces. Matterport 3D scans capture spatial data faster but processing takes longer as cloud servers generate 3D models. Efficiency improves dramatically after creating first few tours as workflows become routine.
